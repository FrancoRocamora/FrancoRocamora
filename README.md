# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Franco Rocamora from Mendoza, Argentina, and I'm 22 years old. I have a background in piano, having studied it for 9 years, but last year I decided to switch my profession to programming. I have a great passion for programming and enjoy learning new languages and technologies on my own.

## ðŸ”­ Currently Working On
I'm currently working on a new web project called **MediTrack**. It's an app designed to help you keep track of your medical records and appointments.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
I'm currently focused on learning Python and TypeScript to enhance my programming skills and broaden my knowledge in different areas.
